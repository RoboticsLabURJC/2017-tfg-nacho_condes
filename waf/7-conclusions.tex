\section{Conclusions}

In this paper we have presented a personal following behavioral, taking advantage of one of the possible synergies between both presented fields: \emph{robotics} and \emph{deep learning}, which are yielding a really promising results in these days.\\


As it has been explained, this system implements two concurrent blocks, performing operations related to \emph{perception} and \emph{actuation}. This leads into a fast and efficient following system, capable of keeping the track on an individual person even without a continuous checking of its identity (its face, in this approach).\\

On an experimental point of view, the infrastructure allows to test different detection and reidentification models, in order to implement more robust ones to perform a slower but preciser following, or to connect the system to a different motor system. The source code of the entire system is available online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/roboticsurjc-students/2017-tfg-nacho_condes}}\\


This allows a simple robot to perform a successful tracking of a person, just knowing its face beforehand.
