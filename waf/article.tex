		The proposed following behavior combines a \emph{perception} and a \emph{control} module. Perception module addresses the person detection on images using a pretrained TensorFlow SSD \emph{Convolutional Neural Network}. It provides \emph{robustness} over traditional methods, although care has to be put on not losing real-time operation. A \emph{person tracker filter} has been included to alleviate the effect of false positives/negatives. It also extracts faces, which are also analyzed by a \emph{siamese network} to reidentify the tracked individual. This perception module tells which person in the image has to be followed, even on poorly lightened scenarios. It is combined with depth readings to obtain the relative position of the person. The control module implements a case-based \emph{PID} controller for a reactive smooth response, moving the robot towards the target person. The entire system has been experimentally validated\footnote{\url{https://jderobot.org/Naxvm-tfg}} on a real Turtlebot robot, with an Asus Xtion RGBD camera.
