The proposed following behavior combines a perception and
a control module. Perception module addresses person detection on images using a pretrained TensorFlow SSD person detection Convolutional
Neural Network. It provides robustness over traditional methods, although care has to be put on not losing real-time operation. A person tracker filter has been included to alliviate the effect of false positives/negatives. It also extracts faces, which are analyzed by a siamese
network in order to reidentify the tracked individual. This perception
module tells which person in the image has to be followed, even on poorly
lightened scenarios. it is combined with depth readings to obtain the relative position of the person. The control module implements a case-based
PID controller for a reactive smooth response, moving the robot towards
the target person. The entire system has been experimentally validated 3
on a real Turtlebot robot, with an Asus Xtion RGBD camera.
