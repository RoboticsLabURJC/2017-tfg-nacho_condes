The proposed following behavior has been developed com-
bining a perception and control modules. The perception module ad-
dresses person detection on the incoming images using a pretrained Ten-
sorFlow SSD person detection Convolutional Neural Network, offering
robustness over traditional methods, although care has to be put on not
losing real-time operation. This is also supported by a person tracker that
eliminates the effect of false positives/negatives. It also has a face detec-
tion block, which extracts faces to be analyzed by a siamese network, in
order to reidentify the tracked individual person. This perception mod-
ule tells which person in the image is the one to follow, even on poorly
lightened scenarios. This is combined with depth readings, to obtain the
relative position of the person. The control module implements a case-
based PID controller for a reactive smooth response, moving the robot
towards the target person. The entire system has been experimentally
validated on a real Turtlebot robot, with an Asus Xtion RGBD camera.
