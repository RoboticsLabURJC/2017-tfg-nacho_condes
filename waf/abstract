The proposed following behavior has been developed com-
bining a perception module and a controller module.
The perception module addresses person detection using a Convolutional
Neural Network to process the incoming images. Its main benefit over
traditional methods is the robustness, but care has to be put on not
losing a real-time operation. This module uses a pretrained TensorFlow
SSD person detection CNN. In order to increase the robustness, we have
also implemented a person tracker that eliminates the effect of false pos-
itives/negatives. It also has a face detection block. The extracted faces
are analyzed by a siamese network, in order to reidentify the tracked in-
dividual person. This perception module tells which person in the image
is the one to follow, even on poorly lightened scenarios. This is combined
with depth readings, to obtain the relative position of the person. The
control module implements a case-based PID controller for a reactive
smooth response, moving the robot towards the target person. The en-
tire system has been experimentally validated on a real Turtlebot robot,
with an Asus Xtion conventional RGBD camera.
