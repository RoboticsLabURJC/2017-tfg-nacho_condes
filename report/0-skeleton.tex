\chapter{Objectives and Methodology}

\section{Objectives}
With all this in mind, the objective of the present work has been to get a little further on \textbf{deep learning applied to robotics}, developing two sucessive components.
\subsection{Detection}
As it will be described on the suitable chapter, we have built a component (\texttt{Object Detector}) which implements \textbf{a generic object detection structure} on an image. This component is ready to work in \emph{real time} (processing a streaming video flow).\\

\subsection{Reactive behavioral}

The next milestone was to be able to connect this intelligent perception to a reactive behavioral, translated into a robot following a certain person. This requires of two main abilities:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Object detection and discrimination: this is just what we achieved with the previous component. We only have to constrain the detections to only keep persons.
	\item People reidentification: as it will be seen, the component is able to track a certain person (which is called \emph{mom}). This is achieved with a person-by-person face comparison with a reference face (which belongs to \emph{mom}). This process is performed by a \emph{siamese neural network}, which is inspired by [tfm marcos pieras].
\end{itemize}

With these capabilities, we can perform a neural control over physical actuators. Its main avail is the significant strength that a \emph{convolutional neural network} can keep on variable light conditions, which is the main Damocles sword on the image processing field.

\section{Methodology}
The workflow present on this project has been supported by weekly meetings.
